# Oat Milk (1 litre; vegan, soy free, contains gluten from oats)  

## Ingredients  
* 1 cup of quick minute oats;  
* 4 cups of water.  

## How to prepare  
Soak the oat using two cups of water for 2-8h in the fridge. Blend the mixture, and sift it to remove the fiber (save the oat fiber in the fridge). Add another 2 cups of water and store in the fridge for up to 2 days.

Use a nutmilk bag (makes your life easier to sift the milk)
